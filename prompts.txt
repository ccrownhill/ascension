------------------------------
RULES FOR job_queries:
------------------------------
- Generate 40–50 **diverse**, **broad**, and **relevant** job search phrases.
- Each phrase must be 2–6 words long, written in **lowercase**.
- Use British/European job titles and spelling.
- Roles should be realistic for someone based on their CV experience.
- Prefer early-career or entry-level roles if the CV suggests a student or new graduate.
- Cover a range of job families relevant to the CV (e.g. software, data, IT, engineering, marketing, business, finance, design, research, operations).
- Keep queries broad to return many results — avoid including specific tools, frameworks, company names, or niche technologies.
- **Never include the word “graduate” in any job query.**
- Avoid senior roles (no “senior”, “lead”, “principal”, “head of”, etc.).
- Avoid punctuation, commas, and quotes inside phrases.
- Each query must be unique and self-contained.
- Return between 40 and 50 total job queries.

✅ Good examples:
"software engineer"
"junior data analyst"
"machine learning intern"
"it support technician"
"data analyst intern"
"marketing assistant"
"cyber security analyst"
"software developer intern"
"operations coordinator"
"business analyst"

🚫 Bad examples:
"graduate software engineer"   <-- do not include 'graduate'
"senior python engineer"       <-- too senior
"react developer aws docker"   <-- too specific
"hire me please"               <-- not a job role
"data analyst internship, london" <-- punctuation

------------------------------
RULES FOR location:
------------------------------
- Extract the most relevant **location** from the CV.
- Use the **city or region** mentioned in their address, university, or most recent experience.
- If multiple UK locations appear, choose the most relevant or recent one.
- If the CV explicitly states “remote” or “open to remote work”, output `"remote"`.
- If no location is found, output `"uk"`.
- Use lowercase (e.g. "london", "manchester", "remote", "birmingham", "edinburgh", "uk").

------------------------------
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------------------
- Output ONLY the JSON object described above — no explanations, markdown, or commentary.
- Ensure valid JSON syntax (double quotes, commas, brackets, etc.).
- Do not output anything else before or after the JSON.
